# All-Digital Phase-Locked Loop (ADPLL) on FPGA

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the design, simulation, and hardware implementation of a complete All-Digital PLL. [cite_start]The system was developed as part of the Master's degree coursework at the **University of Pisa**[cite: 9, 43].

## Key Features
- [cite_start]**Language**: Verilog HDL[cite: 43].
- [cite_start]**Hardware**: Altera DE2 FPGA board.
- [cite_start]**Tools**: Quartus Prime for synthesis and ModelSim for functional verification[cite: 43, 60].
- [cite_start]**Verification**: Real-time phase-tracking analysis conducted via oscilloscope[cite: 45, 61].

## Implementation Details
The design includes:
1. Phase Frequency Detector (PFD).
2. Digital Loop Filter.
3. Digitally Controlled Oscillator (DCO).

[cite_start]The stability of the loop and its tracking performance were verified through extensive ModelSim simulations before being deployed on the Altera hardware.

## Documentation
The repository includes the full technical report detailing the mathematical models, simulation results, and hardware testing procedures.
